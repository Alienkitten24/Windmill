Mouse Trap: Marble Mayhem Windmill Project

Mouse Trap: Marble Mania is a child friendly marble music machine with styling that draws inspiration from the classic children's game Mouse Trap. This stylized marble machine allows for a user to have an interactive display of falling marbles that play an array of different songs by striking the 7 different notes in the c major scale on xylophone style keys. The kids toy consists of a bi directional windmill, an Archimedes screw, a marble track that leads into a track selector, a 7 run marble xylophone striking apparatus, and a run off track that connects it all back together.
